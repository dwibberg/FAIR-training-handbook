<h2>9.7. Content</h2>
<h3>9.7.1. - Why sShould I share my training material?</h3>
 There are inherent benefits of sharing training material for researchers. Making training material available to learners and other instructors, the training material developers better manage their training material, ensure the training material is of high quality and take care of copyright problems. Instructors can benefit from shared training material by stimulating interest and mobilizing new potential training course participants. Thus, training material sharing can help to raise recognition and prominence of the instructor.
 In addition, sharing training material encourages more connection and collaboration between instructors, which can result in important new aspects within the training field. In a time of reduced investments and high interest in training, sharing of training material is efficient for instructors, e.g. sharing training material also allows instructors to build upon the work of others rather than repeat already existing material.
 Despite the many benefits gained from sharing training material, there are important considerations that instructors must be aware of when sharing their training material. There are concerns that others will use the training material inappropriately or out of context. Lastly, instructors may also be uneasy about the prospect of not receiving acknowledgement by others who use their material. While these are valid concerns, often maintaining good data sharing practices can largely address many of these issues.

 <h3>Chapter 9.7.2. - Where and how should I share my training material?</h3>
 There are several possibilities to share your training material with the scientific community and to enhance the discoverability. The next sub-chapters show “Best Practices” and suitable platforms for boosting the discoverability.  

 <h4>Chapter 9.7.2.1. - Sharing training material by means of TeSS <a href =https://tess.elixir-europe.org>(https://tess.elixir-europe.org)</a></h4>
 Contributing to the overall training strategy of ELIXIR, the UK ‘Node’ piloted a Training e-Support System (TeSS) for aggregating and discovering training information across Europe and beyond since 2015. In addition, TeSS provides the latest news of ELIXIR-wide training events and materials. TeSS platform offers a ‘shop window’ to the worldwide training landscape focusing on ELIXIR training events. As a central registry, it boosts the discoverability of training activities and resources across and beyond Europe. TeSS offers an easy-to-use interface, including faceted filtering and search features to help users browse and discover training information. TeSS allows users to register their training materials manually. However, this requires significant effort to ensure that information is registered in a timely manner and updated regularly. Consequently, TeSS’ primary mechanism for acquiring training metadata is to aggregate from content providers automatically. Bespoke scrapers isare run daily to extract information from a range of target websites to collect different training materials. All training providers have to annotate their content with Bioschemas profiles in order to be scraped. Bioschemas is a community project built on top of schema.org, aiming to improve interoperability and findability in Life Sciences projects. Bioschemas inherits the benefits from schema.org, i.e., enabling machines to understand what your metadata is in advance, making it easier to find, integrate, and re-use. In particular, a profile for training materials has been created (June 2022), defining a set of metadata and vocabularies useful to represent them in web pages and make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate life science training material information across the Internet.
In summaryTherefore, the user has two different possibilities to upload training material to TeSS - manual and automatic.

 <h4>Chapter 9.7.2.2. - Sharing training material by means of GOBLET <a href =https://www.mygoblet.org/>(mygoblet.org)</a></h4>
 The Global Organization for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET) has established a training portal, spanning the fields of bioinformatics, biocuration, biocomputing and computational biology. The portal is an evolving resource, providing a freely available collection of materials, courses, and a catalog of trainers. Materials are available under a CC BY-SA 3.0 license for download and use. Mainly, materials and courses are currently uploaded only by registered members and/or by GOBLET-affiliated trainers—i.e. upload to the site requires registration with the GOBLET Foundation (this helps to minimize spurious entries and maintain quality standards). Materials may be presentations, tutorials, datasets, case studies, curricula, etc., and may be linked to their respective training events (courses, workshops, …) . All contents are tagged: tags allow classification or filtering of entities by keywords, making them easy to find and to enhance their discoverability. 

 <h4>Chapter 9.7.2.3. - Sharing the information about the training material upload via your social networks</h4>
 Social media can be an important way to promote your training material to the wider community and make it more discoverable. This can be an even more effective strategy when coming from an author or editor as an expert in the field. Below there are some social media channels that can be recommended for promoting your training material and other channels that will offer a direct way to reach your readership. Don’t forget: You need an user account to post on these channels.
 <h4>Twitter</h4>
 Twitter is one of the simplest social media channels to use for promotion and is an ideal way to reach new audiences and engage with the broader research and training community.
 <h4>Posting Guidelines:</h4>
 <ul>
 <li>Post 2-3 times a day. Frequency is important on this platform to build a good number of followers. This can include original content, as well as retweets or links to other content.</li>
 <li>Tweets should be personal and not written in the style of a press release, marketing email etc. – you are communicating directly with individuals who can respond to you immediately.</li>
 <li>Brevity is important. Twitter limits posts to 280 characters, including links. As such, you can abbreviate, write fragments, and do not have to use proper grammar.</li>
 <li>Images and Videos – posts with images and videos are much more highly interacted with, try to ensure there is a mix of posts including images, video and just text.</li>
 <li>Link to content – it is important to always link to external content within tweets. Exceptions are when posting a question, answering someone else’s tweet, or engaging in an ongoing conversation (or Twitterchat).</li>
 <li>Be aware of space – with a 280 character limit since November 2017, you now have double the space to clearly communicate your thoughts. However, brevity is still king on Twitter. Start with a strong lead, and only include details that are necessary. Also remember that all links (no matter the visual length) take up 23 of your 280 characters. </li>
 <li>Schedule your tweets. Keeping an active Twitter account can be time consuming. Scheduling your Tweets in advance can help minimize your time spent. While it’s important to monitor your account daily for people that are reaching out to you or to post current news pieces, you can schedule your planned tweets using free resources, such as <a href=https://www.hootsuite.com>Hootsuite</a>. Twitter also has a scheduler native to its system. Both these options will also come with basic analytics so that you can review your successful tweets and adapt your strategy.</li>
 <li>Check your notifications for people who have followed you or mentioned you in a tweet. Always respond to these notifications as this will ensure engagement and a development of your Twitter community. If there is a negative comment, refer to the “Monitoring and responding to posts” section of this document.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Facebook</h4>
 Facebook has evolved over time and now is a great place to create personal connections with others based on common interests. Join groups or like pages around training, areas of expertise, school, or workplace. Additionally, users can join groups organized by city, workplace, school, or college. You can also join and create groups according to your training material or areas of expertise.
 <h4>LinkedIn</h4>
 LinkedIn is not just for career opportunities. It is a global network of professionals with over 500 million members. You can include links to your training material when you create your profile, as part of the summary of your professional expertise and accomplishments, or on your feed.
 <h4>Instagram</h4>
 Instagram provides an opportunity to create interest in your training material through visuals. Infographics, short videos, or visual storytelling of the research journey can be shared on this platform. This platform is also unique because link sharing is not allowable in a post, only in your bio. Because of this, focus for Instagram is on engagement within the network instead of driving traffic to your training material.
 <h4>YouTube</h4>
 There is an increasing amount of traffic to training material sites via YouTube, because students use video content as an initial way of getting insights into a topic. If you already have video content relating to your training material, use this in the promotion of your training material.
 <h4>Blogging</h4>
 Blogging is both a form of academic writing as well as an effective way to reach new audiences and increase the discoverability of your training material. 
 <h4>Academic social networking sites</h4>
 These social communities are a way of meeting and conversing with people who share the same training interests. These sites offer an immediate way to monitor what other people are looking at in your field of training.
 <h4>Other channels</h4>
 There are other options to draw attention to your latest training material: email your networks or post on listservs and institutions, society, or personal websites about your recent training material.

 <h4>Chapter 9.7.2.4. - Sharing the information about the training material upload via conference and posters</h4>

 Posters are widely used in the academic community, and most conferences include poster presentations in their program. Training posters summarize information or training concisely and attractively to help publicize it and generate a better discoverability.  
 The poster is usually a mixture of a brief text mixed with tables, graphs, pictures, and other presentation formats. At a conference, the presenter stands by the poster display while other participants can come and view the presentation and interact with the trainer. However, posters display 'only' the training material at a given instant with no possibility of keeping them up to date or expanding them. Nevertheless, to raise interest at a conference, the following suggestions can be used to boost your poster. 
 <h4>Boost your poster:</h4>
 <ul>
 <li>Important information should be readable from about 10 feet away</li>
 <li>Title is short and draws interest</li>
 <li>Word count of about 300 to 800 words</li>
 <li>Text is clear and to the point</li>
 <li>Use of bullets, numbering, and headlines make it easy to read</li>
 <li>Effective use of graphics, color and fonts</li>
 <li>Consistent and clean layout</li>
 <li>Includes acknowledgments, your name and institutional affiliation</li>
