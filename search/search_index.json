It will cover the different licence options available to date and consider the implications for users. It will also explain the practicalities of implementing your chosen licences and give an awareness of common issues to consider. Prerequisites Learners should have material that they would like to share and consider attaching a licence to. Learning Outcomes List the differences between the various licence schemes and licence types Describe the implications for users of materials and how this impacts on your choice What are licences and why are they required? Licences are a standardised way of giving others specific permissions to use work you created. They allow you to put your work out publicly, while providing guidance to users about how they can use your materials and whether there are any restrictions. By making your training materials public, others can benefit from your work and experience. It also benefits you as it increases the possibility of your materials being used in the way you would like and in a way that provides you with credit for your work. By attaching a licence to your materials, you get to keep some control over how they can be used. For example, you may be happy for anyone to use your materials, provided you are credited, or perhaps you would like to allow anyone to use the materials, but only if they make no changes to them. Selecting the right licence allows you to make these choices and communicate them to your users. It\u2019s important to remember that not having a licence assigned does not mean that anyone is allowed to do anything with the material, but instead creates confusion around what is allowed. Licence schemes There are many different licensing schemes available, each with different types of licences that allow you to choose what users of your materials can do with them. Some common licensing schemes include Creative Commons, MIT License, Apache, and GNU General Public License. The most common type of licence used for training materials is Creative Commons and we\u2019ll discuss these further later on in this chapter. Your choice of scheme and licence will depend on a number of factors, such as the type of materials, who the materials are targeted at, what you anticipate users wanting your materials for, any rules your institute may have already, and any materials you include within yours. Learning activity: find some examples of licences on training materials This learning activity will help you think more critically about how licences can be used. Find three examples of training materials that include a licence Do they all use the same licence scheme or type of licence? Are you clear on how you can use the materials or do you require more information? Were the licences easy to spot? Creative Commons licences There are four conditions which can be applied to your materials by Creative Commons licences: Image taken from https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/6/6d/6licenses-flat.pdf. The image is in the public domain, CC0. These four conditions can be combined to make up six different types of Creative Commons licences for you to choose for your materials: Image taken from https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/6/6d/6licenses-flat.pdf. The image is in the public domain, CC0. You can label your materials with the above logos to help users quickly know which licence you have applied to your materials. Logo images are available for download from Creative Commons. There is also the option to use CC0 which allows you to put materials in the public domain, meaning users can do whatever they like with the materials, with no conditions attached. Before adding a licence to your training materials, it is important to keep in mind that licences cannot be revoked. The materials will remain covered by the licence you chose, even if you decide to stop distributing the materials later on. Learning activity: choosing a licence To help you decide which licence is most suitable for your materials, Creative Commons provides a licence chooser. In the following activity, you will try out the Creative Commons licence chooser for yourself. Select some of your training materials that you would like to add a licence to. Try the Creative Commons Licence Chooser to determine which licence is most suitable for your selected materials. Consider the licence the Chooser identified, do you think it is suitable for your materials? Remember, you may also need to consider requirements and restrictions set by your institute or company. Attaching a licence to your materials Once you have chosen a licence for your materials, you need to ensure you communicate that licence to all users of your materials. Logos and images that illustrate the chosen licence can be a great way of adding the licence to your materials. But to make sure all users understand what the licence means, you should add a link to the page that details the licence where possible. For example, if you use a CC-BY licence, link to the relevant page on the Creative Commons website. Reusing licenced materials If you wish to reuse someone else\u2019s materials you must first check that the licence they have applied to them allows it. You will also need to ensure that you recognise and cite their work appropriately ( see Chapter 10 ). The licence that you can apply to the new version of the materials depends on the original licence and how you have changed, adapted or remixed the materials. Creative Commons provides a guide on how to do this in different situations . Licences checklist Clearly label your materials with the chosen licence Include your contact information in case anyone needs to ask you any questions about your materials or their use Cite any other creators\u2019 materials that you include in yours - do not reuse others\u2019 works if you are not sure about their permissions Check with your institute/company if there are any specific licence rules or guidance Next steps Choosing an appropriate licence is an important step in encouraging appropriate recognition of your work and encouraging contributions and collaborations.

Description This chapter will explain why it is important to add attributions to your training material. We will define the roles of author, trainers and contributor and ways of how to attribute credit to them in the contact of training material. It will also discuss of how you can encourage others to contribute to your material. Learning Outcomes Recognise the importance of attribution Explain why it is important to encourage continous contributions and acknowledgements Define the difference between author, trainer and contributor Define criteria for acknowledgements Describe roles for credit attribution as an additional way of credit attribution Describe ways to engage communities (trainers and trainees) to get contributions and feedback Use persistent identifiers for people in the context of attribution Describe how to capture contributors and authors depending on the repository / platform Provide credit for other training material Importance of attribution of credit Attributing credit is as important for training material as it is for scientific literature. While in the scientific literature authors and co-authors are listed, the following roles play an important part in the context of training material. Author Teacher / trainer Contributor We will define these roles in more detail in the next section and also clarify how credit is attributed for each of them. Attributing credit to these roles makes them (most often scientists) more visible, serves as proof of their effort beyond pure research and can bring these scientists additional recognition. In addition, it clarifies the responsibilities of those who contributed to certain content of the training material and the training session and thus allows trainers who will re-use the training material to contact these people with potential follow-up questions. In the end, attributing contact creates a community of trainers and contributors. Exercise Potential learning experience: Search for training material online and analyse how credit is attributed and to whom. (in groups, 10 mins, 5 min search, 5 min wrap-up) Different roles Each author is expected to: Have made substantial contributions to at least one of the following: a. conception or design b. creation of exercises c. creation of lectures d. creation of the learner\u2019s environment e. drafting/revision Have approved the course version Be personally accountable for their contributions Each teacher / trainer is expected to have had interactions with learners during the respective course version as part of a didactic process. Each contributor has contributed to the course material including, but not limited to: Improvement of exercises and lectures Testing and evaluation of exercises/lectures/learner\u2019s environment Everyone who does not meet authorship, contributor or trainer criteria but deserve so should be acknowledged. For example, persons or organisations should be attributed if their course material was used as base or inspiration for the current course material version. Ideally this should be in the form of a citation. Note Minimum information for citations: Author, year, material title, version, DOI To eliminate name confusion and ensure appropriate attribution to the authors and teachers, it is highly recommended to adapt ORCID iDs. Where to list them? Authors On the course website main page, including ORCiD. In the README.md in the github repository. In the .zenodo.json file Any other appropriate metadata file Teachers On the course website main page, including ORCiD. Contributors In the case of a repository: automatic contributor of the repository. Otherwise, where appropriate (see below at Acknowledgment/citation ) Acknowledgement / Citation Where appropriate: - At the course website main page for general acknowledgement (e.g. \u2018this course was inspired by \u2026\u2019) - At the appropriate presentation slide - At the appropriate course page Importance to encourage contribution It is important to encourage contribution to training material as this will allow for the training content to develop over time, and thus to be kept updated. In addition potential mistakes can be identified and corrected. And the quality of the material will increase with more contributions. Acknowledging contributions serves as a motivation for people to contribute and will drive the formation of a community of interest. Credit matrix It is more and more common in scientific literature to use a matrix for clarifying contributions to a publication. Such a matrix provides a standardised list of contributor roles and allows to assign authors to these roles. One example of such a matrix is the CRediT matrix. The CRediT matrix was reworked for the purpose of training material and is provided below. It should become best practice to use such a matrix also for training materials. The CRediT matrix can be helpful in evaluating whether a person is an author or contributor. Usually an author has made a significant contribution to one or more roles in the CRediT matrix. Related to this, it can be used to describe the actual responsibilities of the different authors. CRediT role Relevance training Interpretation in training context Conceptualization Yes Concept of the course.
